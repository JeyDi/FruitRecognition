Fruit Recognition Neural Network Projects

Neural Network Fruit Recognition experimentation built with 3 different solution:
1. Transfer Learning Techniques
2. Feezing Layers Techniques
3. Custom CNN Network

Used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits

To download the dataset download you kaggle.json config file from the kaggle platform with username and password and use the custom code inside the repository (dataset_downloader.ipynb) to download the dataset in the right position inside the folder.

I suggest to create a custom keras-gpu workspace with Anaconda to use this project with tensorflow-gpu.
All the required dependencies are stored into requirements.txt file that you can use to install your environment with pip.

In the code there are also the onnx implementation for keras (read and write models)
